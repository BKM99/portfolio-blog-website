                            I graduated from San Jose State University (SJSU) with a B.S in
                            Management Information Systems and minors in Computer Science and
                            Mathematics. During my undergraduate studies, I geared much of my
                            coursework to learning the fundamentals of programming, the math
                            that powers machine learning, and project management. I enjoy
                            using programming and math to build exciting projects.

                            Outside of programming, I love powerlifting and bodybuilding. I
                            started going to the gym during the summer of my second year at
                            university. That was about 3 years ago since then Iâ€™ve seen and
                            felt major changes to my physique and mental health. Going to the
                            gym has taught me about dedication and patience. These are some of
                            the values that I take with me whenever I start a new project or
                            try to learn something new.
